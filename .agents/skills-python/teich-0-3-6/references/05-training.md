# Training

The recommended Teich training flow is trainer-first:

1. `prepare_data()` renders trainer-friendly text rows and stores Teich supervision spans.
2. `SFTTrainer` or your trainer setup tokenizes those rows.
3. `mask_data()` converts Teich spans into labels after tokenization.

This works well with TRL and Unsloth because Teich does not need to guess token offsets before the trainer has applied its own tokenization path.

## Minimal pattern

```python
from teich import mask_data, prepare_data

train_dataset = prepare_data(
    "username/my-agent-dataset",
    tokenizer,
    max_length=32768,
    oversized_policy="trim_followups",
    tokenize=True,
    chat_template_kwargs={"enable_thinking": True},
)

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    args=SFTConfig(
        dataset_text_field="text",
        max_length=32768,
        packing=False,
        output_dir="outputs",
    ),
)

trainer = mask_data(
    trainer,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    train_on_reasoning=True,
    train_on_final_answers=True,
    train_on_tools=True,
)

trainer.train()
```

Keep `packing=False` for this flow because packed datasets merge row boundaries before masking.

## What `mask_data()` does

Before `mask_data()`, the trainer dataset usually contains:

```python
{
    "text": "...",
    "teich_supervised_spans": [...],
    "input_ids": [...],
    "attention_mask": [...],
}
```

After `mask_data()`, Teich replaces trainer datasets with:

```python
{
    "input_ids": [...],
    "labels": [-100, -100, 1234, 5678, ...],
}
```

Where:

- `-100` means "ignore this token in loss"
- non-`-100` labels are the exact tokens selected by the masking policy
- prompt, user, system, developer, and tool-output context stays masked by default
- assistant reasoning, final answers, and tool calls become supervised by default

When the tokenizer supports batched offset mappings, `mask_data()` tokenizes each dataset-map batch together instead of issuing one tokenizer call per row.

Per-model terminator handling:

- For Qwen-style templates, the initial `think` tag is intentionally included in supervision.
- For Gemma 4, Teich supervises exactly one closing `<turn|>` for a completed model turn whenever reasoning, final-answer, or tool-call supervision is enabled for that turn. It does not add a second terminator inside a continuing tool-call chain. The terminator remains a target even when the final answer is masked, so reasoning-only and tool-only fine-tunes still learn to stop. Empty final assistant messages and unresolved tool-result prefixes do not create synthetic `final_answer` spans.
- For Granite 4.2, the equivalent stopping token is `
</think>

`. Each enabled assistant reasoning, answer, or tool-call target retains its completed-turn terminator, including reasoning-only and tool-only masking policies.

`mask_data()` raises `ValueError` when packing is enabled, when a row's labels would be entirely `-100`, or when the supervised-token cap drops every row.

## Masking policy

`mask_data()` trains on these by default:

- assistant reasoning
- assistant final answers
- assistant tool calls

You can override the policy:

```python
trainer = mask_data(
    trainer,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    train_on_reasoning=True,
    train_on_final_answers=True,
    train_on_tools=True,
    train_on_user=False,
    train_on_system=False,
    train_on_developer=False,
    train_on_tool_responses=False,
)
```

For native Claude Code imports, masked system context may include Claude Desktop skills, MCP instructions, hook context, permission state, date changes, and session recaps recovered from the native transcript. It stays masked unless `train_on_system=True`.

Other options: `max_supervised_tokens` (cap on trainable answer tokens per row), `audit` (run SFT label audit), `text_column`.

## Supervised token limits

For long-context runs, `max_supervised_tokens` defaults to the trainer's `max_length` when available. This caps the number of trainable answer tokens per row without changing the context window:

```python
trainer = mask_data(
    trainer,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    max_supervised_tokens=8192,
)
```

If every row is dropped by the supervised-token cap, Teich raises instead of silently training on nothing.

## Source reasoning policy

`reasoning_policy="keep"` is the default and leaves structured assistant reasoning for the loaded chat template to handle according to its own model contract. `reasoning_policy="strip"` removes normalized `reasoning_content` before rendering. This is deliberately independent of `mask_data(train_on_reasoning=False)`: masking keeps gold reasoning in the causal context, whereas stripping creates a true instruction-only example.

The policy can be set per source in a mixed dataset. `PrepareReport` records the affected row and message counts in `reasoning_stripped_rows` and `reasoning_stripped_messages`.

## Live Gemma 4 models

For the live Google Gemma 4 instruction checkpoints, keep the chat template loaded from the selected model repository. The supported smoke-tested targets are:

- `google/gemma-4-E4B-it`
- `google/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it`
- `google/gemma-4-31B-it`

Gemma 4's thinking mode is a prompt protocol, so Teich resolves it for every row before rendering. Leave `enable_thinking` unset for the recommended auto mode:

- a row containing assistant `reasoning_content`, `thinking`, or `reasoning` becomes a thinking row
- a row without assistant reasoning becomes a non-thinking row
- thinking rows automatically receive `enable_thinking=True` and `preserve_thinking=True`, preserving historical reasoning in multi-turn data
- a leading legacy `<|think|>` in system/developer content is removed and used as a thinking-mode hint. `PrepareReport` records the migration, while triggers in any other position are rejected

The live template, not the source data, inserts `<|think|>` into the system turn. The 26B-A4B and 31B generation prompts also insert an empty thought channel in non-thinking mode while E4B does not. Teich discovers that behavior from the loaded template and mirrors the prefix in completed SFT turns while keeping the synthetic prefix masked.

Explicit `{"enable_thinking": True}` and `{"enable_thinking": False}` remain available when an entire source must be forced to one mode. Teich automatically enables history preservation for the explicit thinking case. Contradictions fail closed: forcing non-thinking on a reasoning-bearing row, or explicitly disabling `preserve_thinking` when historical reasoning would disappear, raises an error instead of producing inconsistent training text.

Do not replace `tokenizer.chat_template` unless you are intentionally testing a maintained fork. Teich supervises the closing `<turn|>` token for completed Gemma responses while keeping system, user, tool-response, and generated prompt prefix context masked.

Thinking and non-thinking examples can therefore be mixed in the same source without any template configuration:

```python
train_dataset, prep_report = prepare_data(
    "username/mixed-gemma-traces",
    tokenizer,
    tokenize=True,
    strict=True,
    return_report=True,
)
```

With `return_report=True`, inspect `prep_report.gemma4_modes` for the resolved thinking/non-thinking counts and `prep_report.gemma4_legacy_triggers_normalized` for migrated legacy rows. Source-level `chat_template_kwargs` are still useful as explicit policy overrides, but are no longer required merely to mix the two modes.

`gemma4_example.py` (repo root) uses the live remote template by default. Set `CHAT_TEMPLATE_PATH` only to opt into a local custom template. Its `GEMMA4_THINKING_MODE` defaults to `auto`; use `thinking` or `nonthinking` only to force a homogeneous source. The older `GEMMA4_ENABLE_THINKING` variable is still accepted for compatibility. Set `MODEL_REVISION` when a reproducible non-`main` revision is required. Set `HF_TOKEN` to an account that has accepted the Gemma repository terms when the checkpoint is not already available through the local Hugging Face login.

The example keeps reasoning in its agent source and strips reasoning from its direct-chat source. Override those source policies with `AGENT_REASONING_POLICY` or `CHAT_REASONING_POLICY` when using datasets with a different contract. It prints the resolved Gemma mode counts, stripped-row count, and maximum token length before training. Do not add `<turn|>` to source messages: Teich derives and supervises the live template's completed-turn terminator automatically.

The Gemma 4 example sets `UNSLOTH_RETURN_LOGITS=1` because Gemma 4's fused-loss path has had silent zero-gradient failures with response-only labels. Run the example in a dedicated, internally consistent Unsloth training environment and check it with `python -m pip check` before a long run. Teich's core environment does not pin the CUDA, PyTorch, Unsloth, and TRL stack because those versions depend on the host GPU and CUDA runtime.

## Live Granite 4.2 models

Teich smoke-tests the released IBM checkpoints with their live remote chat template:

- `ibm-granite/granite-4.2-3b`
- `ibm-granite/granite-4.2-8b`
- `ibm-granite/granite-4.2-30b`

Granite 4.2 uses `think.../think` reasoning and supports full thinking, non-thinking, and low-effort thinking. Leave `enable_thinking` unset during preparation for Teich's recommended per-row auto mode. Rows with structured assistant reasoning use thinking mode; direct rows use non-thinking mode and retain Granite's required `think
/think` inference primer as masked context. The final answer and closing `
</think>

` remain supervised.

The live template defaults `truncate_history_thinking=True` for inference to save context. That is unsafe as an SFT default because every assistant turn is a training target. Teich therefore supplies `truncate_history_thinking=False` while preparing Granite 4.2 rows. Explicitly requesting truncation fails closed when it would remove historical source reasoning. With `return_report=True`, inspect `prep_report.granite42_modes` for `thinking`, `nonthinking`, and `low_effort` row counts.

For low-effort reasoning, use the live template's `low_effort=True` setting:

```python
train_dataset = prepare_data(
    "username/granite42-reasoning-traces",
    tokenizer,
    chat_template_kwargs={"low_effort": True},
    tokenize=True,
    strict=True,
)
```

`reasoning_effort="low"` is accepted as a compatibility alias and normalized to `low_effort=True` before the template is rendered.

For true direct-instruction tuning from a reasoning-bearing source, strip the reasoning before rendering. Setting `train_on_reasoning=False` only masks its loss; it does not remove reasoning from causal context:

```python
train_dataset = prepare_data(
    "username/granite42-direct-traces",
    tokenizer,
    reasoning_policy="strip",
    tokenize=True,
    strict=True,
)
```

Do not add `think`, `think
</think>`, or `
</think>

` to source messages. The live template and Teich's per-row contract produce and mask those protocol tokens. Tool results remain masked by default, while assistant tool calls and their completed-turn `
</think>

` are supervised.

`granite42_example.py` is a complete text-only LoRA example. It defaults to the 8B checkpoint, uses Granite's per-row auto mode, and applies optional `GRANITE42_LOW_EFFORT=1` only to the reasoning-bearing agent source. Override `MODEL_NAME` to use the 3B or 30B checkpoint without changing the preparation contract.

## Live Qwen 3.8 models

Qwen 3.8 has a different native contract and Teich does not apply Gemma's auto mode rules to it. The live `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B` template defaults to thinking, defaults `reasoning_effort` to `xhigh`, and preserves historical `reasoning_content` unless `preserve_thinking=False` is supplied. To train its native reasoning behavior, retain those defaults or set only the desired effort:

```python
train_dataset = prepare_data(
    "username/qwen38-reasoning-traces",
    tokenizer,
    chat_template_kwargs={"reasoning_effort": "medium"},
    tokenize=True,
    strict=True,
)
```

Supported live efforts are `low`, `medium`, and `xhigh`. Continue to use `train_on_reasoning=True` in `mask_data()` when those reasoning tokens should receive loss.

For direct instruction tuning from a dataset that still contains reasoning, remove the reasoning before rendering and explicitly select Qwen's non-thinking template mode:

```python
train_dataset, prep_report = prepare_data(
    "username/mixed-source-traces",
    tokenizer,
    reasoning_policy="strip",
    chat_template_kwargs={
        "enable_thinking": False,
        "preserve_thinking": False,
    },
    return_report=True,
    tokenize=True,
    strict=True,
)
```

Qwen 3.8's non-thinking prompt contains an empty `think
.../think
` primer. Teich keeps that inference-alignment prefix in the rendered text but masks it from loss. The final answer and closing `
</think>

` remain supervised.

`qwen38_example.py` is a complete text-only LoRA example using the live multimodal tokenizer. It keeps thinking and history preservation on for the agent source, strips reasoning and disables thinking for the direct-chat source, and accepts `QWEN38_REASONING_EFFORT=low|medium|xhigh`.

## Live Qwen 3.6 models

Qwen 3.6 uses a different contract from Qwen 3.8. It supports explicit `enable_thinking` and `preserve_thinking`, but its live template has no `reasoning_effort` control. The template normally keeps only reasoning related to the latest user message, so multi-turn reasoning SFT should explicitly set `preserve_thinking=True`:

```python
train_dataset = prepare_data(
    "username/qwen36-agent-traces",
    tokenizer,
    chat_template_kwargs={
        "enable_thinking": True,
        "preserve_thinking": True,
    },
    tokenize=True,
    strict=True,
)
```

For a direct source, use `reasoning_policy="strip"` with `enable_thinking=False` and `preserve_thinking=False`. Qwen 3.6 does not use the older `/think` or `/nothink` soft switches; do not inject either into data.

`qwen36_example.py` demonstrates both source policies with `Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B`. Override `MODEL_NAME=Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B` to use the dense checkpoint with the same preparation contract.

## Full Unsloth / TRL example

MODEL_NAME = "unsloth/Qwen3.5-0.8B"
CHAT_TEMPLATE_KWARGS = {"enable_thinking": True}
PUSH_TO_HUB_REPO_ID = "username/teich-sft-model"
HF_TOKEN = os.environ.get("HF_TOKEN") or ""

model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(

    tokenizer,
    split="train",

)

trainer = SFTTrainer(

    eval_dataset=None,
    args=SFTConfig(
        dataset_text_field="text",

    ),
)

trainer = mask_data(
    trainer,

trainer_stats = trainer.train(resume_from_checkpoint=False)
print(f"{trainer_stats.metrics['train_runtime']} seconds used for training.")

model.push_to_hub_merged(PUSH_TO_HUB_REPO_ID, tokenizer, save_method="merged_16bit", token=HF_TOKEN)
```

For Unsloth / TRL, pass `tokenize=True` to `prepare_data()` so trainer setup treats the dataset as already tokenized and preserves Teich span metadata until `mask_data()` runs.

## Previewing labels

Use `preview_sft_example()` or the dataset preview helper attached by `mask_data()` to inspect supervised vs masked tokens before training:

```python
preview = trainer.train_dataset.preview(0, tokenizer)
print(preview)
```

This is useful for checking whether reasoning, tool calls, and final answers are being supervised as intended.
