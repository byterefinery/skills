# Cloudflare compatibility

celld runs the Workers runtime, with Durable Objects as the stateful core: module Workers, fetch, JS RPC, service bindings, and static assets. celld does not run the rest of the Cloudflare platform. The scope rule is simple: if Cloudflare builds a function on Durable Objects, celld can get that function; a function on a different primitive is out of scope. Cloudflare builds D1 on Durable Objects, so a D1 binding is a thin layer over what celld already has. KV is a global cache with eventual consistency, and R2 is blob storage — different systems, not on the roadmap.

A configuration or binding that is not available must fail loudly, at deploy or at first use. A silent compatibility gap is a bug; the known gaps are marked below.

## Services

| service | notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Workers** | Module Workers — `fetch`, JS RPC, service bindings, Durable Object bindings, `vars` |
| **Durable Objects** | The stateful core. SQLite storage, alarms, inbound hibernatable WebSockets, outbound `ws:`/`wss:` WebSocket clients (constructor and `fetch()` upgrade), one writer for each cell, names as addresses, RPC methods on stubs |
| **Static assets** | Immutable files served from the fleet bucket — `assets.directory`, `binding`, `html_handling`, `not_found_handling`, `run_worker_first`, plus `_headers` and `_redirects`. An asset-only project deploys without a Worker |
| **Worker Loader (Code Mode)** | Experimental. Bind a loader with `CELLD_WORKER_LOADER`; a Worker can then start sandboxed isolates at runtime |

## Planned and not planned

**Planned** — **D1** (a D1 database is a Durable Object with a SQL API; celld already has the hard part), **Workflows** (durable execution over cells and alarms), **Queues** (a Durable Object shape; if demand appears).

A note on durable execution, because the two terms are close: a durable-execution engine (Temporal, Restate, Azure Durable Functions) models a *process* — a sequence of steps that ends. A cell models an *entity* — a named unit with state that persists indefinitely. You can build either primitive on the other — Cloudflare builds Workflows on Durable Objects — so choose the one that matches the shape of the problem. A concert, a user, and a document are entities; an order pipeline is a process.

**Not planned** —

- **KV** (a different consistency model), **R2** (celld runs *on* blob storage and does not provide it; declared `r2_buckets` bindings load, but each method throws)
- **Cache API**, **Workers AI**, **Vectorize**, **Hyperdrive**, **Browser Rendering**, **Email** (managed platform services; an experimental HTTP adapter for an AI binding exists behind `CELLD_AI_URL`)
- **cron triggers, custom domains, TLS termination** (platform surface; celld has its own durable alarms — put TLS in your ingress proxy)
- **Python Workers** (workerd supplies the Pyodide runtime and the Python module shim; that layer is platform surface, not a function on Durable Objects; celld can add support if demand appears)

## Runtime APIs

| API | status |
| --- | --- |
| Fetch, Request, Response, Headers | **Yes.** Gaps — `Response.redirect()`, `Response.error()`, and the `cache` request option are missing |
| Bindings (`env`) | **Yes** for Durable Objects, service bindings, `vars`, assets. Other binding types are out of scope |
| Context (`ctx`) | **Yes** — `waitUntil`, `props`, `exports`. `passThroughOnException()` is accepted but has no effect (there is no CDN behind it). `ctx.facets` is absent |
| Handlers | `fetch`, `alarm`, `webSocketMessage`/`Close`/`Error`, RPC methods. **No** `scheduled` (cron), `queue`, `tail`, or `email` handlers |
| RPC | **Yes**, for most of the surface — see [RPC](#rpc) |
| Streams | **Yes** — byte streams, BYOB readers, `tee`/`pipeTo`/`pipeThrough`, `IdentityTransformStream`, `FixedLengthStream`, `CompressionStream`/`DecompressionStream`. Gap — `ReadableStream.from()` |
| Encoding | **Yes** — `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder` (legacy encodings included), encoder and decoder streams, `atob`/`btoa` |
| WebSockets | **Yes**, inbound (hibernatable, with attachments) and outbound. An attachment holds anything that structured clone accepts. Auto-response works — `setWebSocketAutoResponse` answers a matched message without a wake of the cell. Gap — `getTags()` |
| Web Crypto | **Partial** — `digest` (including MD5), HMAC sign and verify, AES-GCM, RSA-OAEP decrypt, Ed25519 and ECDSA-P256 sign, and `verify` for RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 and ECDSA-P256 (RS256 and ES256 JWTs). `importKey` and `exportKey` handle `spki`, `pkcs8`, `jwk`, `raw` for RSA, EC (P-256, P-384, P-521), Ed25519 and X25519, validating at import; keys cross to `node:crypto` through `KeyObject.from()`. `generateKey` covers AES, HMAC, RSA (OAEP, PKCS#1 v1.5, PSS), EC P-256 and Ed25519. Cloudflare extensions `timingSafeEqual` and `DigestStream` (CRC32, CRC32C, CRC64-NVME) are available. AES-CBC, AES-CTR, and AES-GCM (12- or 16-byte IVs). ECDH `deriveBits` and `deriveKey` on P-256, P-384, P-521. Missing — `wrapKey`/`unwrapKey`, RSA-PSS *signing*, HKDF and PBKDF2 through `deriveBits` (available through `node:crypto`). An algorithm that is not available throws |
| Web standards | **Yes** — `URL`, `URLSearchParams`, `URLPattern`, `AbortController`/`AbortSignal` (with `timeout()`, `any()`; a signal does **not** abort across an RPC call, and `signal.onabort` is accepted but never invoked — use `addEventListener('abort')`), `Blob`/`File`/`FormData`, `Event`/`EventTarget`, `DOMException`, `queueMicrotask`, `structuredClone` (not conformant on exotic types), `navigator.userAgent` |
| WebAssembly | **Yes** (V8's own, without restrictions) — a bundle can import a `.wasm` file as a compiled module, as on Cloudflare; see [07-wasm](07-wasm.md) |
| Performance and timers | `setTimeout`/`clearTimeout`, `setImmediate`, `scheduler.wait()`. **`setInterval` throws.** `performance.now()` has millisecond resolution; the other parts of `performance` are stubs |
| Console | `log`/`info`/`warn`/`error` are real. `debug`/`trace`/`group`/`table` do nothing. `assert`/`time`/`count` are absent |
| Node.js compatibility | **Partial** — see [node: imports](#node-imports) |
| Facets (`ctx.facets`) | **No.** A Durable Object cannot create a facet, and `ctx.facets` is not defined. There is no first-class `DurableObjectClass` value, so `ctx.exports` gives no stub for a Durable Object class that the configuration does not declare |
| Cache (`caches`) | **No** |
| HTMLRewriter | **No** |
| TCP sockets (`cloudflare:sockets`) | **No.** Known silent gap — `connect()` currently gives an inert stub. It does not throw |
| EventSource, MessageChannel, BroadcastChannel | **No.** The classes exist so that bundles load, but they do nothing |

## RPC

celld implements the Workers JS RPC system — `WorkerEntrypoint` and `RpcTarget` from `cloudflare:workers`, named entrypoints on service bindings, and method calls on Durable Object stubs (this needs `extends DurableObject`, or the `js_rpc` compat flag). Arguments and returns use structured clone; functions, streams, and `RpcTarget`s become stubs. Promise pipelining, `ctx.exports` loopback stubs, and stubs in DO storage are available. `ctx.exports` covers the entrypoints that the configuration declares, so it gives no stub for an undeclared Durable Object class.

Current limits:

- A cross-isolate service binding with a named entrypoint can do single method calls, but not `fetch()`, awaitable properties, or pipelined paths; a same-isolate binding has the full surface.
- A stub cannot cross an isolate boundary yet, and a Durable Object is its own isolate. A Durable Object method therefore takes and returns structured-cloneable values. If you pass a function to one, or return an `RpcTarget` from one, the call throws `RPC stubs cannot cross isolate boundaries yet`.
- Callbacks, `RpcTarget` instances, and promise pipelining all work through `ctx.exports`, which shares the isolate.

The [`rpc` example](https://github.com/denoland/celld/tree/v0.2.1/examples/rpc) shows each of these.

## Dynamic Worker loading (Code Mode)

Set `CELLD_WORKER_LOADER=LOADER`. Workers then get `env.LOADER`. This is an experimental port of Cloudflare's Worker Loader. `loader.get(name, getCode)` (memoized) and `loader.load(code)` start a new isolate for each loaded worker.

Honored inputs — `mainModule`, sibling `modules`, `compatibilityDate`/`Flags`, plain-JSON `env`, and `globalOutbound: null` (no egress). Limits — the workerd limits of 64 MiB of code and 1 MiB of env, plus the `CELLD_MAX_LOADED_WORKERS` limit. A loaded worker serves `fetch()` and single RPC method calls. Not yet available — `globalOutbound` as a Fetcher, capability stubs in `env`, awaitable or pipelined properties.

## node: imports

`node:` specifiers are always available; the `nodejs_compat` flag is not necessary, and celld does not read it. `celld deploy` externalizes `node:*` at bundle time. The runtime supplies its own subset (it does not use the Wrangler-style unenv polyfills):

- **Implemented** — `node:assert`, `node:async_hooks` (a real `AsyncLocalStorage`), `node:buffer`, `node:events`, `node:path`, `node:stream` (+ `stream/web`, `stream/promises`, `stream/consumers`), `node:timers/promises`, `node:util`.
- **Partial** — `node:crypto` (hashes, HMAC, HKDF, PBKDF2, `webcrypto`, secret key objects, asymmetric keys, and one-shot signatures. `createPublicKey` and `createPrivateKey` read PEM, DER and JWK for RSA, EC (P-256, P-384, P-521), Ed25519, X25519 and DSA, including password-protected PKCS#8, and give a key with `asymmetricKeyType`, `asymmetricKeyDetails`, `toCryptoKey()` and `export()` to DER, PEM or JWK. `generateKeyPairSync` covers RSA, EC P-256, Ed25519 and X25519. `sign()` and `verify()` cover Ed25519, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 and ECDSA P-256, with DER signatures as Node's `dsaEncoding` default requires. What still throws — Diffie-Hellman throughout, the streaming `createSign`/`createVerify`, ciphers, RSA-PSS, DSA signing, and key generation for DSA and DH). `node:zlib` (only the sync `gzip`/`deflate` family). `node:fs` (reads fail with `ENOENT`, `existsSync` is `false`).
- **Not implemented** — the rest (`node:http(s)`, `node:net`, `node:tls`, `node:dns`, `node:os`, `node:process` (the `process` global exists, the module does not), `node:worker_threads`, `node:vm`, `node:child_process`, and the others). Known silent gap — these currently give inert stubs; they do not fail the import.

## Compatibility flags

`compatibility_date` and `compatibility_flags` are honored for the switches that celld models — `delete_all_deletes_alarm`, `js_rpc`, `fetcher_no_get_put_delete`, `sqlite_vec`, `websocket_standard_binary_type`, and the assets navigation behavior. The `sqlite_vec` flag enables the pre-v1 sqlite-vec extension, and a compatibility date never enables it. `Cloudflare.compatibilityFlags` reports only the flags that celld honors — a flag that celld does not model is absent rather than reported as enabled, and celld accepts it without effect.

## Wrangler configuration

`celld deploy` builds a standard Wrangler project (esbuild on `PATH`) and accepts `wrangler.jsonc` or `wrangler.json`, **not** `wrangler.toml`. The available config keys are `name`, `main`, `compatibility_date`, `compatibility_flags`, `durable_objects`, `migrations`, `assets`, `services`, and `vars`. An asset-only project can omit `main`. celld refuses symlinks and special files in the asset directory, and `.assetsignore` still needs Wrangler. Each other key — `routes`, `kv_namespaces`, `triggers`, and the rest — stops the deploy with an error that names the key: remove the key, or deploy that project with Wrangler.
